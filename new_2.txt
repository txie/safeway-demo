please use SWY app to check now, you should see previous items plus items added in last two days
one catch here:  current iphone APP only looking for flag "MFG" for CC offers, but all CC offers added to list should be "MF", and that's what we are using for migration,
so you need to use SWY android app to check the list if you find some CC offer does not show up in the list



now please use 5F app, you should see same item set as SWY app.


add item one by one, after add one from 5F app, check SWY app, it should show up there.
